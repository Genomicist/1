Description: RoaRyVis is an R package that processes output data from the pangenome software, Roary ("Roary: Rapid large-scale prokaryote pan genome analysis", AJ Page et al., 2015.). In a pangenome study, the genomic DNA a population of a certain species is sequenced, and the genes are predicted in silico. Roary compares the predicted genes of each genome, examines if certain genes are similar enough to be considered as the same gene, and outputs a table containing the presence and absence of each predicted gene in all genomes.
