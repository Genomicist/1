# RoaRyVis

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

RoaRyVis is an R package that processes output data from the pangenome software, Roary ("Roary: Rapid large-scale prokaryote pan genome analysis", AJ Page et al., 2015.). In a pangenome study, the genomic DNA a population of a certain species is sequenced, and the genes are predicted in silico. Roary compares the predicted genes of each genome, examines if certain genes are similar enough to be considered as the same gene, and outputs a table containing the presence and absence of each predicted gene in all genomes.

## Installation


Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("davidtong28/RoaRyVis")
```
The github repository for RoaRyVis is https://github.com/davidtong28/RoaRyVis.

## Example

So far there is only one visuallization function wrapped by RoaRyVis, namely the distributionplot function, which returns a plot showing the distribution of genes present in a given number of genomes in a population.

```{r example}
library(RoaRyVis)
distributionplot("testdata/campylobacter.csv","con","test_campy")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
